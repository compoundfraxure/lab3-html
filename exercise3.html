		<h2>About</h2>
			<p class="info">Barnum's Animals Crackers are a brand of animal crackers. They're little biscuit-like crackers shaped like animals like zebras and elephants and lions and penguins and rats and cute anime girls. They were recently a subject of political outrage due to recieving a redesign so that they were not displayed in cages (of course, the only ones who were outraged on both sides were total partisan hacks because I didn't even notice that they were in cages before).</p><p>But I'll always associate them with the Kansas City Royals in 2015. During game 5 of the 2015 World Series the announcers were hyping up the performance of Mets pitcher Matt Harvey, who had shut out the Royals through 8 innings. And my Dad was just sick of them poring over him. But then Harvey gives up a leadoff walk and surrenders a double as the start of a Royals comeback. Then Matt Harvey gets pulled and my Dad starts booing and throwing animal crackers at our TV. And wouldn't you know it, the Royals completed the comeback and won the World Series that same night. Wait, what was I talking about? Oh yeah, Barnum's Animal Crackers are pretty tasty too.</p>
