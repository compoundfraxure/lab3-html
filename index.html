		<p style="background-color: lightcoral">This is a lab that really encourages you to be creative. Which is bad for me considering that I am terrible with actually designing things that look good and instead just trying to think of witty text to put on my pages. But anyways, here are my exercises for this lab:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th><a href="exercise1.html">Exercise 1</a></th>
				<th><a href="exercise2.html">Exercise 2</a></th>
				<th><a href="exercise3.html">Exercise 3</a></th>
				<th><a href="exercise4.html">Exercise 4</a></th>
				<th class="rightmost"><a href="https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~w553p157/lab3-html">Exercise 5</a></th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Wherein you can try to create a password that gets validated in cleartext. Don't ever do that on a real website, though.</td>
				<td>Wherein you can see my main avatar, an image of an octopus I found in Eloquent Javascript, and my favorite gif of all time, among other images, in a convenient slideshow.</td>
				<td>Wherein you can learn all about Barnam's Animal Crackers and what happened in my house the night the Royals won the World Series.</td>
				<td>Wherein you can make the GNU/Linux copypasta look all pretty and stylized.</td>
				<td class="rightmost">Wherein you can go to this page on my KU website if I did this whole thing right.</td>
			</tr>
